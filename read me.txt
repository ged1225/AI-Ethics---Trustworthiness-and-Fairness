The code is adapted from the open-source GitHub repository [https://github.com/LLMBias/BiasLens].

Compared with the original BiasLens project, the main modification is the removal of the additional prompt templates that distinguish among “Yes/No,” “Choice,” and “Wh” question types, so the model is queried directly with the question itself.
Other minor adjustments include small changes to the input and output formats to fit this project’s question bank (**question.xlsx**), as well as modifications to input/output paths and output column names.

Model versions used for testing:
GPT-5.1 (https://openrouter.ai/openai/gpt-5.1) and Llama 4 Maverick 17B Instruct (128E) (https://openrouter.ai/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick).
